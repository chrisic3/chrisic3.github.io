          <p>
            Hello, my name is Chris. I have spent the majority of my life around technology, everything from interactive robotic toys as a child, tinkering with old computers to learn how they work, helping family and friends with their own technological needs, or more recently learning more in-depth about software development. Over the past five years I have held a position as a Database Administrator during which I taught myself how to use Microsoft SQL Server 2008, SQL Server Reporting Services, and SQL Server Report Builder. I also learned basic HTML and CSS in order to manage parts of the web-based software our staff uses to interact with the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am in the process of earning my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Information Technology with a minor in Software Engineering and hope to have it completed within the next two and a half years. I have also taken independent courses online through places like Udemy and EdX; some of the topics studied are Java, MySQL, C language, and recently a Web Developer Bootcamp (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB). I am excited about the career opportunities these skills are opening up for me, as well as to possibility of pursuing something I am passionate about in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to read a little about me, and I hope you enjoy my portfolio.
          </p>
